# DXWorkout demo

A sample application that demonstrates the power of the [PhoneJS mobile framework](http://phonejs.devexpress.com/) and [ChartJS data visualization widgets](http://chartjs.devexpress.com/). 

This mobile application is designed to become your assistant at the gym. It helps to track your daily workouts over time. In addition to logging trainings, you can also watch your progress on the charts.

DXWorkout is built with MVVM in mind. It uses HTML5 localStorage to store data, and the PhoneGap API for its splash screen and for persisting user data when a user leaves the application.

Ready to be turned into a native application via packaging services, such as [PhoneGap Build] (https://build.phonegap.com/apps).
